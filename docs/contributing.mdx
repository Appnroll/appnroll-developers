# Contributing

## In General

As a programmer, one of your responsibility is to contribute code to the project you're working on.
We're using git version control for that purpose. Our repositories are stored on GitHub and we're
using tools available there to help with the work.

## In Details

We're most comfortable with a basic flow of making a feature branch for a specific task and merging
it directly to master when it's done. It's much easier to understand and we're much faster with
deployment of new features (no massive deploys of stuff waiting for weeks).

Jira is our project management tool of choice and we're using certain conventions in our git work
to help with self organisation and make it wasier for developers comming after us to find the source
of specification of a particular unit of code.

All of our code is reviewed by at least one other developer. Code review is an important part of our
quality control process but it also helps with the knowledge sharing and learning of our whole team.

All of your pull requests are built on Netlify and accessible on a unique URL so you can show off
your work, get feedback and see how your app really works. This speeds up the whole process of
development and feedback loop and make it easy to just share around what you've made.

After you're done with the code and you got some reviews, your code will be controlled by
Quality Assurance Engineer to make sure it follows the specification and works well in the wild.
This step might bring some additional tasks for you to fix, but don't worry. It's all in order to
make better products.

## Pull Requests Good Practices

It's a good idea to create a Pull Requests even when your code is not ready yet. Just mark it
as "Work in Progress". That way you might get some feedback faster and let other developers know
what you're working on.

When creating a PR, follow the PR tempalte added to the project. It usually have some convenience
fields added that will help reviewers understand the scope of your PR. Do not forget to add
some screenshots!

Commits are part of your pull request. Make sure they are meaningfull and properly describe changes
indluded in the bundle. Avoid non-descriptive names like "CR fixes", "wip", "stuff changed". It will
not only helo reviewers to get a better understanding of the PR, but also will make it easy for people
working on your code later to learn why particulat change was made.

## Code Review Good Practices

As a reviewer, you take partial responsibility for the quality of the code you're reviewing.
Pay close attention to potential mistakes and bugs. Fetch and run the code yourself to get a hold
on it.
