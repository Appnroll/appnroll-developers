# Skills

## About

As a programmer, you have a rich set of different skills you use to deliver the highest quality of software.
In App’n’roll we especially appreciate skills related to web development in JavaScript and React, but your
other skills (soft and hard) are also important.

We split those different skills into buckets with two main categories, based on the skill’s importance.
Core skills are the ones that you especially need for the day to day work in App’n’roll and are necessary
for the company to provide the best quality solutions to its clients. Our strategy is based on them and we
invest our time and effort in learning and mastering them to the best of our abilities.

Supporting skills, on the other hand, are skills that help you with your and company’s goals.
They make you a better communicator, more specialised developer and a better programmer overall.
Don’t neglect them!

## Core skills

### JavaScript and TypeScript

TypeScript is our language of choice. As a superset of JavaScript it gives us the JS’ flexibility with
safety and convenience of static types. All of our technical stack uses this language so it’s important
for you to be proficient in using it.

### Front-end

We’re creating websites and web applications, so it’s necessary for you to be able to use HTML, CSS
and other web technologies to make slick apps and great interfaces. Some SEO knowledge is a plus.
Responsive design is a must. Eye to details helps.

### React

Our favourite framework for creating UI. React helps us with creating fast and reliable apps fast,
by increasing our productivity and ability to implement even weirdest ideas of the design team.

## Supporting skills

### Higher level React tooling

Our stack consists of many tools based on React and enriching the framework. We extensively use
Gatsby to create static websites and apps. Our styles are written in Styled Components. Testing
is done in Jest. React Testing Library and Cypress. You need to know those tools to be productive
in App’n’roll.

### Soft skills

It’s your general attitude towards your colleagues, clients and your work. Are you a good communicator?
Do you provide constructive feedback? Do you help everyone with your expertise? That’s the kind of
questions you need to ask in order to assess your soft skills level.

### Teaching ability

The more senior you become, the more important teaching becomes. You need to be able to help your
junior colleagues grow. You should be able to provide guidance and leadership in their learning efforts.
This includes your engagement in code reviews and pair programming.

## One more thing

### Perceived quality of work

You know the good work when you see it. This is a measure of your general quality of work.
If you have an eye to details, ship well tested and properly implemented code that means
you’re high on the scale. Even better if clients are happy and users love what you did.
