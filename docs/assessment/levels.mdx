Your assessment note might use an arrow pointing from one level to another (for example 4→5). This means
you’re on a track to advancing to another level in one or two assessment periods. Keep up the good work,
follow the recommendations you were given and and increase your skill to meet expectations of another level.
You’ll be there faster than you think.
