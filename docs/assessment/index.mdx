# Introduction

## What it is about?

Assessment is a process of receiving a feedback for the person responsible for your growth
in the company. It's meant to help you focus on what's important from the point of view
of your personal development, your growth as a programmer as well as from the point of view
of the company's strategy to serve its clients well.

You'll receive an assessment quarterly. It's going to be about an hour long talk with your leader.
During this talk you should expect to get an objective evaluation of your skills and work quality.
You'll get some suggestions about possible areas of improvements and issues that might affect
your work.

Feel free to give the feedback yourself about how the company is run, how your lede helps yoo
with your goals and what ideas about general improvements you have. Sharing this knowledge is
a first step to make the ~~world~~ company a better place to be in.

## Assessment Card

Before the talk you should receive the assessment card. It's a formalized outcome of the assessment
meeting that will help you prepare for the talk and will make it easy to refer to its findings
after a while.

Below is an example of that card.
