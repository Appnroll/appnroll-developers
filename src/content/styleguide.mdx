# General

## Prettier, Linter and other automatic tools

Most convention you'll find in this guide requires some manual, intentional effort from programmer. Thankfully all other
stuff that's not included is hidden in automatic tools configuration. Most of those configs are the tools' defaults
with some notable exceptions you'll find reading this guide.

# Files and modules organisation
## Files naming convention

When naming files, you need to remember about few things.
- Use the kebab case convention so the filename will look like it's a part of the URL. We're web devs after all.
- Usually add a file type suffix informing what type of file it is (e.g `.component`). That way it'll be easier to find
  the file you need.
- Name the file the same as the main (default) export.

The available file type suffixes (list is non-exhaustive):
- `.component` for React components,
- `.stories` for files holding Storybook stories,
- `.test` for unit tests,
- `.e2e` for end-to-end tests,
- `.fragment` for GraphQL fragments,
- `.interface` for interfaces,
- `.request` for modules exposing an HTTP request.

There are some modules that doesn't need that suffix. It usually happen when the filename is important (like in the
`/pages` folder in Gatsby projects) or the exported value is a function (then `.function` suffix would be redundant, as
the module name alone would inform it's a function, eg. `get-some-data.ts`).

### Examples

```ts
contact-form.component.tsx
contact-form-component.stories.tsx
contact-form-component.test.tsx
contact-form-component.e2e.tsx
user-profile.fragment.ts
user-profile.interface.ts
get-user-profile.request.ts
parse-user-profile.ts
```

## Creating components

Use `AppFunctionComponent`.
Prefer functional components with hooks.
named default export

```typescript
interface Props {
  propA: string
  propB?: number
}

const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = ({propA, propB = 42}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {propsA}: {propB}
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

## Styling components

Don't export styled components unnecessarily.

If you need them in multiple files, then maybe you need a separate file for that component.


```typescript
const HeaderRoot = styled.header`
  background: red
`

const Header: AppFunctionComponent = () => {
  return (
    <HeaderRoot>App'n'roll</HeaderRoot>
  )
}

export default Header
```
