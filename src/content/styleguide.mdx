# General

## Prettier, Linter and other automatic tools

Most convention you'll find in this guide requires some manual, intentional effort from programmer. Thankfully all other
stuff that's not included is hidden in automatic tools configuration. Most of those configs are the tools' defaults
with some notable exceptions you'll find reading this guide.

# Files and modules organisation

## Files naming convention

When naming files, you need to remember about few things.
- Use the kebab case convention so the filename will look like it's a part of the URL. We're web devs after all.
- Usually add a file type suffix informing what type of file it is (e.g `.component`). That way it'll be easier to find
  the file you need.
- Name the file the same as the main (default) export.

The available file type suffixes (list is non-exhaustive):
- `some-name.component.tsx` for connecting store to component (Redux's `connect`)
- `some-name-ui.component.tsx`, for standard React components,
- `some-name.styled.tsx` for Styled components,
- `some-name.stories.tsx` for files holding Storybook stories,
- `some-name.test.tsx` for unit tests,
- `some-name.e2e.tsx` for end-to-end tests,
- `some-name.hook.tsx` for hooks,
- `some-name.fragment.tsx` for GraphQL fragments,
- `some-name.types.tsx` for interfaces, types, enums, etc.
- `some-name.request.tsx` for modules exposing an HTTP request,
- `some-name.fixture.tsx` for data used in tests.

There are some modules that doesn't need that suffix. It usually happen when the filename is important (like in the
`/pages` folder in Gatsby projects) or the exported value is a function (then `.function` suffix would be redundant, as
the module name alone would inform it's a function, eg. `get-some-data.ts`).

### Examples

```ts
contact-form.component.tsx
contact-form-component.stories.tsx
contact-form-component.test.tsx
contact-form-component.e2e.tsx
user-profile.fragment.ts
user-profile.types.ts
get-user-profile.request.ts
parse-user-profile.ts
```

## Folders structure and files organisation

Folders structure of the whole project should be built with _domain driven development_ in mind. This will make it clear and easy to navigate. A project `src` directory should contain only domains (modules). Each module should be responsible for a separate functionality, its API should be clear, obvious and what's the most important - it shouldn't cause circular dependency with other modules. If it does, its worth to rethink and refactor the code (maybe split it into even smaller modules?).

The module has no obligatory structure. It may contain only one file or the whole app-like structure containing store, sub-components, internal routing, helpers etc. However, there are few rules that should be applied (if needed):
- `<module>/components` is an obvious directory to store all components used in given module
- `<module>/store` should contain all store related stuff
- `<module>/img` is for storing images, SVGs, etc.
- `<module>/constants` should contain constants used only in given module
- `<module>/helpers` should contain all helper functions used across the module, including its store and sub-components; 
  **it means there should be no `<module>.helpers.ts` files (or similar) as each helper function should be a separate file with its own `test` attached**

> **Note:** Each module should be treated as an independent _package_ that can be easily transferred to other project by just copying files and using its API. This imply that all components, constants, store etc. used in given module should be encapsulated. However, this is the best-case scenario so don't try to follow this rule at all costs. Just switch your mindset to that approach and write the code that will be as modular as possible :wink:

### Examples

  - a `routing` module
    ```
     ── routing
        ├── routes.tsx

    ```

## Avoid index files

Do not create `index` files that reexport values from files inside a catalogue. They add unnecessary work that needs to
be done and checked for correctness, as well as it needs to be kept in sync in case new exports will show up.

# Style

## Use two spaces

It keeps a healthy balance of readability in your code editor and in GitHub code review screen.

_Configured in Prettier._

## Keep the line width to 80 characters

This makes it much simpler to work on multiple files at once open in adjacent tabs. It also helps during code review
as the code won't soft-wrap in unexpected places (when you're using split view).

_Configured in Prettier._

## Don't use semicolons

Keep the code clean and avoid adding unnecessary semicolons.

_Configured in Prettier._

## Use double quotes or template strings

Avoid using single quotes. Double quotes are required by HTML and are a default JSX convention so it keeps everything
consistent.

_Configured in Prettier._

## Use verbs for functions

Whenever creating a function, prefix it with an actionable verb. It makes it obvious for anyone using the value
that it needs to be called. It's also easier to understand the effect of calling it.

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
const isActive = something => something.active // => true
const activate = something => something.active = true
const greet = () => alert("hello!")

// Bad.
const openHandler = () => ... // Obvious where to use but not obvious what will happen.
const activator = () => ... // Not obvious what will happen.
const onClick = () => alert("hello!")
```

## Use adjectives for boolean values

Use adjectives or similar form for boolean values. Do not use the `is` prefix for non-functional values. Try to keep
it similar to what HTML does (active, disabled, etc.).

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
const open = true
const selected = false
const inTransition = true

// Bad.
const isOpen = true
const selection = false
```

## Avoid !! ("double bang")

It's an obscure way of converting a value to a boolean. It's easily mistaken with a plain negation and requires
more mental capacity to properly understand. Prefer simple and explicit `Boolean(value)` or don't convert at all
as it's usually not required.

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
const booleanValue = Boolean("hello")

// Bad.
const supposedlyBooleanValue = !!"hello"
```

## Use screaming case for global constants

When you expose some constant values globally in the app (either by exporting it or using it as a static class property),
use the SCREAMING_CASE to inform consumers that value is not a part of the module and is not meant to be changed by
code. Immutability should be ensured within a reason. The convention is native to JavaScript.

### Examples

```typescript
// Basic configuration value.
export const DEFAULT_COUNT = 10

// Component allowing to access its default config.
export class Slider {
  public static readonly DEFAULT_COUNT = 5
}

// Native object's global value.
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
```

## Comments placement and style

When describing your code by using comments, place them above the code it relates to. This is a common convention throught plethora of codebases so it became a common expectation. Avoid putting any comments in the same line and behind the commented code. It's unexpected and difficult to reason about and hard to read due to the need of horizontal scrolling.

Whenever possible, use inline comments using `//`. Reserve multi-line comments for documentation.

### Examples

```typescript
// This a valid comment. Everyone knows it describes the line below.
const someFn = () => {}

const anotherFn = () => {} // This is not a good place for a comment.

const someMoreFn = () => {
  ...
} // This comment looks like it describes `theLastFn`, so it's bad.
const theLastFn = () => {}
```

## Boolean attribute in JSX

- Simple is better
- Less code is better
- Looks more pro

### Examples

```typescript
//good
<Hello personal />

//bad
<Hello personal={true} />
```

# Code

## Component's module structure

Keep all important pieces that create a full component definition in one place. Splitting those parts in separate
files brings chaos and makes it harder to understand the full functionality at a glance. You'd have to keep multiple
files open and manage the tabs clutter to work on a single piece of code.

### Example

```typescript
/* Good. Everything in one place. */
interface MyComponentProps {
  hello: string
}
const Component: AppFunctionComponent<MyComponentProps> = () => { ... }
export default Component

/* Bad. Have to keep an eye at multiple files. */

// my-component.interface.ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  hello: string
}

// my-component.component.ts
const Component: AppFunctionComponent<MyComponentProps> = () => { ... }
export default Component
```

## Creating components

Prefer function components over class components for the smaller code-print. Use the `AppFunctionComponent` interface
to type the component. Declare it as a constant and then export that constant as a default export of the module. Keep
only a single component in a file (with an exception of styled components that makes up the main component).

### Example

```typescript
const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = () => {
  return <div />
}

export default MyComponent
```

## Component's properties

Declare the component's properties as the `Props` interface and use it in the AppFunctionComponent generic type.
Destructure the properties in the parameters declaration and provide default values for optional properties there
(if it makes sense for a prop to have a default).

### Example

```typescript
interface Props {
  property: string
  optionalProperty?: number
}

const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = ({ property, optionalProperty = 42 }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {property}: {optionalProperty}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Avoid destructuring props if it isn't needed

Try to keep passing props as simple as possible. Avoid destructurization if you can pass the whole object or part of it by using the rest operator.

### Example

```tsx
// Good.
const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = (props) => {
  return <div {...props} />
}

const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = ({ otherProperty, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <div otherProperty={otherProperty}>
      <div {...props} />
    </div>
  )
}

// Bad.
const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent<Props> = ({ otherProperty, ...props }) => {
  return <div otherProperty={otherProperty} {...props} />
}
```


## Prrefer explicit return over arrow return in components

Arrow returns tend to create massive diffs when a code that needs to be outside of the initial return statement is added to the component. Avoid this scenario by always using curly braces with the explicit return.

### Example

```typescript
// Good.
const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent = () => {
  return <div />
}

// Bad. Will create a big diff when changed.
const MyComponent: AppFunctionComponent = () => <div />
```

## Hooks

## AppFunctionComponent and its extensions

`AppFunctionComponent` interface is a basic component type in all of our applications. On top of extending the React's
`FunctionComponent` it provides two additional benefits:

- it makes all the properties on the root lever `readonly` to prevent their accidental modification,
- it adds `className: string` property so that all components will be easily stylable.

When the app have some other specific properties that all components can use, then extend the `AppFunctionComponent`
rather than creating a new name variant to avoid confusion for developers working on other apps.

```typescript
// Base AppFunctionComponent
interface AppFunctionComponent<P = {}>
  extends FunctionComponent<Readonly<P & { className?: string }>> {}

// Extended interface
interface IntlProps {
  intl: (label: string) => string
}

interface AppFunctionComponent<P = {}>
  extends FunctionComponent<Readonly<P & { className?: string } & IntlProps>> {}
```

## Styling components

Don't export styled components unnecessarily.

If you use some styled components in many places, their place should be in separate file with styled.tsx extension.

```typescript
const HeaderRoot = styled.header`
  background: red
`

const Header: AppFunctionComponent = () => {
  return (
    <HeaderRoot>App'n'roll</HeaderRoot>
  )
}

export default Header
```

### Props of styled components

If props definition of a component is short and used individually, add it inline. It will be easier to read, because usually there are a lot of styled components defined in a one file.

```typescript
const Button = styled.button<{ pending: boolean }>`...`
```

If a styled component becomes to be more advanced one (with many props or its props are reuseable), consider creating a dedicated interface for it.

```typescript
// Could be hard to read
const Button = styled.button<{ pending: boolean, wide: boolean, empty: boolean, ... }>`...`

// Much better
interface ButtonProps {
  pending: boolean
  wide: boolean
  empty: boolean
  ...
}

const Button = styled.button<ButtonProps>`...`
```

## Smart and dumb

## Avoid `any`

But not at any cost. Try to figure out the expected type of a value and type it properly so that you and your fellow
programmers will get the benefit of type safety and IDE support.

In rare cases, when type is difficult to use, you can use an explicit `any`. But keep in mind you might get a change
request in code review if the type was not that complex.

# Tests

## Test filenames convention

For unit tests use the `.test.ts(x)` suffix and for end-to-end tests use `.e2e.ts(x)`. That way they'll be easy
to find in the component's catalogue.

### Examples

```typescript
button.test.tsx
checkout.e2e.tsx
```

## Writing tests

## Use `test`

When declaring a test use the `test` function (instead of `it`). It nicely feet into tests (it's a `test` after all).

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
test("writes good tests", () => ...)

// Bad. (Well, not really, but still…)
it("doesn't write good tests", () => ...)
```

## You should not `should`

Keep tests simple. "Works" is enough. We know it should.

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
test("works when clicked", () => ...)

// Bad.
test("should work when clicked", () => ...)
```

## Expose custom getters in the renderer when necessary

### Examples

```typescript
const renderMyComponent = () => {
  const outcome = render(<MyComponent />)
  return {
    ...outcome,
    getButton: () => outcome.getByRole("button")
  }
}

test("clicking a button does something", () => {
  const { getButton } = renderMyComponent()
  // ...
})
```

## Use arrow function as a callback

Use only arrow functions in the test's callback. Don't use function expression or a reference.

### Examples

```typescript
// Good.
test("with good callback", () => ...)

// Bad.
test("with bad callback", function() { ... })
```

## Don't use root level `describe` to just name the component you're testing

The module's filenamename is enough to find a test and know what it is. Use describes only
to group connected functionalities.

### Examples

```typescript
// Bad.
describe("MyComponent test", () => {
  test("", () => ...)
})

// Good. (Just test.)
test("", () => ...)

// Good. (Grouping functionalities.)
describe("when smiling", () => {...})
describe("when having fun", () => {...})
```
